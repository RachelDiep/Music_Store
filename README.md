# Music_Store #SQL_Project #Database_Creation #Data_Retrival #Questions_and_Answers
This project was insprired by an Indian Youtuber sharing his tutorial on Data Analysis.
(His video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFIuIjswMKM&list=PLRY-AYJzifh2rPHy6xtPSwwl-jTW_DMQm&index=10) 
I was lucky and happy to get a full package of data with 13 CSV Files from him, so that I was able to practise database creating skills then completed data retrival based on questions which are from easy to hard level.
How I created the database: by reviewing the pictures of data schema the author provided, I determined what objects I needed for the database ready before loading data into tables. During this datebase creating process, I encountered and solve some problems, such as:
+ What tables should I start build first?
+ How to create constraint as long as we do not miss any connection for tables?
+ How to deal with dd-mm-yyyy formatted data then convert them into DATE type with proper format of SQL SERVER?
+ How to solve problems when importing data into tables unsuccessfully by using BULK INSERT?
+ ...
It took me longer to build objects, importing data and get the database ready than practising data retrival for answering data questions.
